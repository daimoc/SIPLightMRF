# SIPLightMRF
Simple customisable media player and recorder SIP endpoint

## Synopsis

This project is a SIP Video PLayer /Recorder. It uses [drachtio](https://github.com/davehorton/drachtio) for SIP signaling and [FFMPEG](https://www.kurento.org/) for the Media manipulation.

## Motivation

This recorder is made to connect to any classic SIP endpoint like Softphone, PABX or MCU and record remote stream.
It was firstly designed to work with Asterisk and it works with it.
